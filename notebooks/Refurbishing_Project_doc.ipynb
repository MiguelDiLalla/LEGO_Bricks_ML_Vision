    "# LEGO Bricks Identification Project: A Journey of Learning and Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This notebook narrates the development of a project that started as a personal challenge and became a demonstration of creative problem-solving and a deep dive into computer vision. The project explores how computer vision techniques can be used to identify and analyze LEGO bricks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Motivation**\n",
    "As a lifelong learner and a problem-solver, I found this project to be a perfect opportunity to apply my curiosity and drive to a practical challenge. It also reflects a significant moment in my life: transitioning from my work in the hospitality industry to pursuing a career in technology, where my skills and passions can have a greater impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "LEGO bricks come in many shapes and sizes, often with subtle differences. The challenge was to create a system capable of identifying individual bricks and determining their dimensions using computer vision techniques. While the initial scope was limited to 26 distinct brick types, the problem presented several complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variability in brick dimensions and shapes.\n",
    "- The need for accurate annotations to train detection models.\n",
    "- Limited data availability, requiring adaptive solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Initial Approach: Direct Brick Classification**\n",
    "The project began with the idea of classifying LEGO bricks directly using object detection models like YOLO. However, early experimentation revealed significant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset limitations**: The dataset was small, unbalanced, and contained subtle differences between classes.\n",
    "- **Model performance**: Direct classification yielded low accuracy due to the aforementioned challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Adaptation: Focusing on Stud Detection**\n",
    "To overcome these hurdles, the approach shifted towards detecting studs (the small bumps on LEGO bricks) and using their positions to infer brick dimensions. This adjustment allowed for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplified classification logic.\n",
    "- Better utilization of the dataset by focusing on a common feature across all bricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involved:\n",
    "- Annotating images with stud positions using LabelMe.\n",
    "- Training a YOLOv8 model to detect studs.\n",
    "- Developing algorithms to compute brick dimensions from the detected stud positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Experimentation and Iteration**\n",
    "The development process was highly iterative, involving:\n",
    "- Multiple rounds of dataset refinement and augmentation.\n",
    "- Experimenting with model hyperparameters to improve detection accuracy.\n",
    "- Validating the dimension-calculation algorithms with test images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Results**\n",
    "The project achieved:\n",
    "- **Accurate stud detection**: The trained YOLO model demonstrated high precision and recall in detecting studs.\n",
    "- **Dimension calculation**: Algorithms successfully inferred the dimensions of various bricks using detected stud positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visualizations**\n",
    "- Examples of stud detection with bounding boxes.\n",
    "- Graphs showing model performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Reflection and Learnings**\n",
    "This project exemplified the power of curiosity and adaptability in tackling challenges. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The importance of flexibility: Pivoting to a simpler approach yielded better results and deeper insights.\n",
    "2. Learning through experimentation: Iterative testing refined the solution and improved my understanding of the problem.\n",
    "3. A new direction: The project reaffirmed my passion for learning and solving complex problems, motivating me to transition into a technology-focused career.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Future Directions**\n",
    "This project is a starting point. Potential next steps include:\n",
    "- Expanding the dataset to include more brick types.\n",
    "- Refining the detection and dimension-calculation algorithms for production-level accuracy.\n",
    "- Scaling the solution for real-world applications, such as automated sorting or inventory management.\n",
