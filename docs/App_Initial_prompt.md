📌 Structured Plan for Adapting the Project for GitHub Execution
Now that I have all the files and the current folder structure, let's design a clear roadmap for making the entire system work directly from GitHub, without Docker, while keeping: ✅ Professional standards
✅ Smooth execution & imports
✅ User-friendly CLI for running the pipeline
✅ Efficient cache management

🔹 Key Changes by Script
I'll break this down script by script, specifying: 1️⃣ Changes needed
2️⃣ Why it's necessary
3️⃣ Optimal folder placement for smooth imports

1️⃣ Train_cli.py (Entry Point)
📌 Current Issues:

Calls Train_models_docker.py, which is designed for containerized execution.
Doesn’t manage temporary files efficiently (no cleanup logic).
Assumes all dependencies exist inside a container, which we are now avoiding.
✅ Changes to Implement:

Update execution to run directly from GitHub instead of calling a containerized script.
Integrate cache management so temporary files clean up automatically.
Add a --cleanup flag to remove cached datasets/models after execution.
📂 Optimal Placement:

vbnet
Copiar
Editar
lego-yolo-trainer/
│── cli.py  ✅  # Renamed to 'cli.py' (shorter, cleaner)
2️⃣ Train_models_docker.py (Main Training Logic)
📌 Current Issues:

Designed for Docker execution (/app/data/ references need removal).
Hardcoded paths that won’t work in a GitHub execution model.
Doesn’t handle automatic dataset/model fetching properly outside Docker.
✅ Changes to Implement:

Refactor to work with GitHub directory structure instead of Docker.
Replace hardcoded /app/data/ paths with a dynamic cache folder.
Ensure datasets and models are downloaded if missing.
📂 Optimal Placement:

pgsql
Copiar
Editar
lego-yolo-trainer/
│── train.py ✅  # Renamed to a cleaner name ('train.py')
3️⃣ pipeline_utils.py (Utility Functions)
📌 Current Issues:

Functions were made for multiple environments (Docker, local, etc.), but now we only need a general-purpose execution.
No cache-aware logic → This means redundant downloads every time.
Some functions are outdated (e.g., dataset processing doesn’t fully align with train.py logic).
✅ Changes to Implement:

Refactor functions to support a single streamlined execution model.
Implement a smart caching system:
Store datasets & models in ~/.lego_ml_cache/
Auto-delete old cache files on user request
Remove any Docker-specific logic.
📂 Optimal Placement:

bash
Copiar
Editar
lego-yolo-trainer/
│── utils/ ✅  # Move pipeline_utils.py here for better structure
│   ├── data_utils.py  ✅  # Dataset & caching functions
│   ├── model_utils.py ✅  # Model selection & processing
│   ├── augmentation.py ✅  # Augmentation functions
4️⃣ Folder Structure Optimization
📌 Current Issues:

Scripts and data files are scattered across multiple folders.
No clear separation between source code, datasets, and outputs.
Lack of a dedicated cache directory for managing temporary files.
✅ Proposed Folder Structure:

graphql
Copiar
Editar
lego-yolo-trainer/
│── cli.py              # Main entry point for command-line execution
│── train.py            # Training pipeline (previously Train_models_docker.py)
│── utils/              # Utility functions for modular execution
│   ├── data_utils.py   # Dataset management & caching
│   ├── model_utils.py  # Model loading & configuration
│   ├── augmentation.py # Augmentation logic
│── configs/            # Configuration files
│   ├── dataset.yaml    # YOLO dataset structure
│   ├── training.json   # Training hyperparameters
│── cache/              # Temporary storage (automatically managed)
│── models/             # Pretrained YOLO models (fetched if missing)
│── data/               # Downloaded datasets (cleaned up when needed)
│── logs/               # Training logs
│── README.md           # Documentation
│── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
🔹 Summary of Key Implementations
✅ CLI (cli.py) as the central execution point
✅ train.py for the training pipeline, refactored for GitHub execution
✅ A utils/ module for better code organization
✅ A cache-aware system to manage temporary files efficiently
✅ A clean, professional folder structure for better maintainability
